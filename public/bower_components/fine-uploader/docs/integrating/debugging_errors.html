## Debugging Errors

For debugging errors, FineUploader features a `debug` option

1. Set the `debug` option of the FineUploader to true.
2. Open the page where you have a FineUploader.
3. Open developer console in your browser.
4. Try to upload the file. You should see a server response.

It should be `{"success":true}` for completed requests. If it's not,
then you have a problem with your server-side script.
