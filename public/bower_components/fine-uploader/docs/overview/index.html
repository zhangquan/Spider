[![Fine Uploader](http://fineuploader.com/img/FineUploader_logo.png)](http://fineuploader.com/)
Version: {{ PKG['version'] }}
[**Examples**](http://fineuploader.com/#demo) | [**Changelog**](http://blog.fineuploader.com/2013/05/fine-uploader-36.html)
Fine Uploader aims to make file-uploading on the web possible in every browser and mobile device.
It is **cross-browser**, **dependency-free**, and **100% Javascript**.
{: .hero-unit}


### FineUploader is simple

You only need to include one JavaScript file. There are absolutely no other dependencies.
```html
<link href="fineuploader-{{ PKG['version']|e }}.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
<script src="fineuploader-{{ PKG['version']|e }}.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

<!-- The element which will contain Fine Uploader -->
<div id="fine-uploader"></div>

<script>
// Create a Fine Uploader instance after the page has loaded.
window.onload = function () {
    var uploader = new qq.FineUploader({
        element: document.getElementById("fine-uploader"),
        request: { endpoint: '/upload_bucket' }
    });
</script>
```

You're now ready to upload! Told you it was easy.

### FineUploader is powerful

All major browsers (including IE7 and above) and the most cutting-edge HTML5 features are supported. FineUploader is highly customizable too. Along with a pre-styled FineUploader mode, there is also a FineUploaderBasic mode which allow integrators to tweak and customize every aspect of their users' upload experience.
